#### 1. Basic Concepts:

**Components of SAS Programs**
[SAS programs](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_2.htm) consist of two types of steps: DATA steps and PROC (procedure) steps. These two steps, alone or combined, form most SAS programs. A SAS program can consist of a DATA step, a PROC step, or any combination of DATA and PROC steps. [DATA steps](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_2.htm#DATA) typically create or modify SAS data sets, but they can also be used to produce custom-designed reports. [PROC steps](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_2.htm#PROC) are pre-written routines that enable you to analyze and process the data in a SAS data set and to present the data in the form of a report. They sometimes create new SAS data sets that contain the results of the procedure.

**Characteristics of SAS Programs**
SAS programs consist of [SAS statements](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_3.htm). A SAS statement usually begins with a SAS keyword and always ends with a semicolon. A DATA step begins with the keyword DATA. A PROC step begins with the keyword PROC. SAS statements are free-format, so they can begin and end anywhere on a line. One statement can continue over several lines, and several statements can be on a line. Blanks or special characters separate "words" in a SAS statement.

**Processing SAS Programs**
When you [submit a SAS program](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_7.htm), SAS reads SAS statements and checks them for errors. When it encounters a subsequent DATA, PROC, RUN, or QUIT statement, SAS executes the previous step in the program.Each time a step is executed, SAS [generates a log](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_7.htm#log) of the processing activities and the results of the processing. The SAS log collects messages about the processing of SAS programs and about any errors that occur.The [results of processing](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_9.htm) may vary. Some SAS programs open an interactive window or invoke procedures that create output in the form of a report. Other SAS programs perform tasks such as sorting and managing data, which have no visible results other than messages in the log.

**SAS Libraries**
Every SAS file is stored in a [SAS library](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_12.htm), which is a collection of SAS files such as SAS data sets and catalogs. In some operating environments, a SAS library is a physical collection of files. In others, the files are only logically related. In the Windows and UNIX environments, a SAS library is typically a group of SAS files in the same folder or directory.

Depending on the libref you use, you can [store SAS files](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_14.htm) in temporary SAS libraries or in permanent SAS libraries.[Temporary SAS files](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_14.htm#temporary) that are created during the session are held in a special work space that is assigned the default libref **Work**. If you don't specify a libref when you create a file (or if you specify **Work**), the file is stored in the temporary SAS library. When you end the session, the temporary library is deleted. 
[To store files permanently](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_14.htm#permanent) in a SAS library, you assign it a libref other than the default **Work**. For example, by assigning the libref **Clinic** to a SAS library, you specify that files within the library are to be stored until you delete them.
**Referencing SAS Files**
To reference a SAS file, you use a [two-level name](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_17.htm), **\*libref.filename***. In the two-level name, *libref* is the name for the SAS library that contains the file, and *filename* is the name of the file itself. A period separates the libref and filename.To reference temporary SAS files, you specify the default libref **Work**, a period, and the filename. Alternatively, you can simply use a one-level name (the filename only) to reference a file in a temporary SAS library. Referencing a SAS file in any library **except Work** indicates that the SAS file is stored permanently.SAS data sets names can be 1 to 32 characters long, must begin with a letter (A-Z, either uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_), and can continue with any combination of numbers, letters, or underscores.

**SAS Data Sets**
For many of the data processing tasks that you perform with SAS, you access data in the form of a [SAS data set](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_22.htm) and use SAS programs to analyze, manage, or present the data. Conceptually, a SAS data set is a file that consists of two parts: a descriptor portion and a data portion. Some SAS data sets also contain one or more indexes, which enable SAS to locate records in the data set more efficiently.The [descriptor portion](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_23.htm) of a SAS data set contains information about the data set.The [data portion](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_24.htm#Data) of a SAS data set is a collection of data values that are arranged in a rectangular table. [Observations](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_24.htm#obs) in the data set correspond to rows or data lines in a raw data file or in an external database. An observation is the information about each object in a SAS data set. [Variables](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_24.htm#variables) in the data set correspond to columns in a raw data file or in an external database. A variable is the set of data values that describes a particular characteristic. If a data value is unknown for a particular observation, a [missing value](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_24.htm#Missval) is recorded in the SAS data set.

**Variable Attributes**
In addition to general information about the data set, the descriptor portion contains [attribute information](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_27.htm) for each variable in the data set. The attribute information includes the variable's [name](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_28.htm#name), [type](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_28.htm#type), and[length](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_28.htm#length). A variable's type determines how [missing values](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_28.htm#missing) for a variable are displayed by SAS. For character variables, a **blank** represents a missing value. For numeric variables, a **period** represents a missing value. You can also specify [format](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_32.htm#format), [informat](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_32.htm#informat), and [label](http://morgan.dartmouth.edu/Docs/60476/m1/m1_32.htm#label) attributes for variables.
